# Zach Milrod ATM Design Problem

## To run:
- `yarn` (or `npm`)
- `yarn start` (`npm start`)

## Test:
- `yarn test` (`npm test`)

*NOTE*: for tests, you might need to run `yarn test:clean` every now and then if jest doesn't pick up those test files: https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/1506. Run if you see `Could not find source file`
